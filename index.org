#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Each major section of this document is defined in its own file.

You can jump to each file by moving the cursor on an "#+include" line
and typing =C-c '= Note: There is *no requirement* to split, but large
org-mode files can become quite slow to edit, so separate sections help
keeping things fluid...
